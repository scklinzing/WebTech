		<h1>Toys</h1>
		<p>When it comes to pet rats, there is usually a minimal selection of
			toys available to them in the pet stores. However, many rat toys can
			be found masquerading as hampster or bird toys.</p>
		<p>
			In my own opinion, since rats chew on everything (yes, <b>everything</b>)
			you might as well make the toys yourself for cheap. The rats won't
			care, and I know my rats have more fun shredding toys instead of
			playing with them. Here are some do-it-yourself rat entertainment
			options!

		</p>
		<p>This can be created several ways. If using real plants, select a
			wide bin with drain holes punctured in the bottom. Fill it halfway
			with clean soil (make sure it has no added fertilizers, chemicals or
			bugs). Add a handful of birdseed, and water lightly. Wait a few days
			until the seeds sprout. If you wait until the grass is slightly
			root-bound, the rats will have a tougher time flinging it all over
			the place. Make sure not to water the grass two days before, so it is
			not muddy when the rats are playing in it. You can also add some
			treats to get the rats interested. Make sure you place the box in an
			easy to clean area!</p>
		<p>This can also be done with scraps of cloth or shredded paper,
			cardboard, tissies, paper towels, clean wood blocks, wine corks, or
			anything you know your rats would love to chew on and dig through.</p>

		</p>
		<p>This is a great way to cool down your rats on a hot summer day.</p>
		<p>Grab a shallow tray that your rats will fit in. Make sure the
			weight of your rat sitting on the edge will not tip it over. Fill
			shallowly with water. Toss in a few frozen peas. Place in a
			waterproof area, like the bathroom floor or a plastic tarp. Keep a
			towel handy, just in case one of your rats attempts to sneak off and
			make a mess. Rats will jump or wade in the water to nab the peas. If
			the rats are more nervous, they may fish for peas with their paws
			from the pool side.</p>

			Rats love, love, LOVE hammocks. Rats are extremely fond of spaces to
			snuggle into, and hammocks also provide ways to make use of unused
			cage space. Here are some basic hammocks. The patterns for sewing
			these hammocks can be found <a

			as well as many other patterns.

		</p>
		<p>Every rat needs a fort for their free-range area! You can construct
			a fort out of old cardboard boxes, tubbing, pvc pipe, thick rope for
			climbing, bird ladders, or anything else interesting that might be
			fun (but safe) for rats to play on. Remember to cut holes for windows
			and doors!</p>

				alt="bean bag" title="Bean Bag" width="500"></a>
		</p>
		<p>Beanbags are a great way to help keep your rat cool in the summer
			and warm in the winter. A warm beanbag is also useful for sick rats
			to snuggle up to.</p>
		<p>To create a beanbag, cut up some tough fabric (like denim) into a
			square. Size depending on the number of rats. Sew up the side seems
			so that it forms a pillow case, leaving one side open. Fill loosely
			with whole uncooked wheat grains, rice, or small dried beans. Sew up
			the end to close it completely.</p>
		<p>
			Wheat grains, rice, or beans hold temperature very well. For hot
			summer days, place the beanbag in the fridge or freezer to cool down
			before giving it to your rats. In the winter, it can be microwaved
			until it's <b>warm,</b> not hot. Extra layers of fabric may be
			desired if your rats are shredders. However, if they do manage to
			chew into the beanbag, some dry wheat or rice won't hurt them.

				alt="tissue boxes" title="Rats in Tissue Boxes" width="500"></a>
		</p>
		<p>My rats LOVE their tissue boxes. They use them to nest in and sleep
			in cuddle piles. They especially love when I give them tissues as
			well... they like to shred them into bedding. Tissue boxes are also
			useful in the winter if the room is cold. It gives the rats a place
			to snuggle in away from chilly drafts. However, they may need to be
			replaced frequently if your rats are shredders, and they also become
			dirty quickly. You may also use cereal boxes, mailing boxes, shoe
			boxes, etc., with a door cut out. It may be a good idea to have one
			without a floor, so it doesn't become pee-soaked too quickly, but
			mine always overturn it anyway.</p>
		<p>You can also use plastic cartons, like plastic juice or soda
			bottles, which you can wash and will last longer before being chewed.
			Rat igloos can be bought from pet stores, but can be expensive.
			Instead, plastic salad bowls or tupperware can be bought from
			discount stores, and holes can be cut for the door and ventilation.</p>
		<p>If you are so inclined, wood nest boxes are another good option.
			Just be sure to coat the inside and top with stick-on contact to
			waterproof it.</p>
		<p>Teraccotta pots are also a great option in the summer, as they tend
			to remain cooler. They can be placed on the floor of the care or
			wired to the walls or ceiling.</p>

		</p>
		<p>My rats LOVE socks! Several people I know are always giving me
			socks that have holes in them or are missing a twin. Here are some
			ideas for socks!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Sock ropes</b>: Sew the socks end to end, and then twist or
				plait them into a thick climbing rope for your rats. Add a few knots
				for extra grip and then hang it in the cage.</li>
			<li><b>Sock bedding</b>: Cut socks into strips and use it as nest box
				bedding.</li>
			<li><b>Digging socks</b>: Get a cardboard box or basket and fill it
				with socks. Rats will enjoy digging in them.</li>
			<li><b>Sock ladders</b>: Use large socks as a ladder or ramp from one
				shelf to another.</li>
