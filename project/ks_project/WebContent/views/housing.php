		<h1>Housing</h1>
		<p>
			There are lots of options for housing pet rats! Just keep in mind that there 
			needs to be enough space for all the rats housed. It is also important to 
			choose housing that is sturdy and escape-proof. Rats are very clever and if it's 
			possible to escape, they will! Do not use things like hampster cages (the bars are 
			too far apart and the rats will squeeze through) or plastic storage bins as 
			permanent housing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cages will also need to be cleaned regularly. Surfaces will need to be wiped 
			down with a mild, safe cleaning solution and bedding will need to be changed 
			as needed. Sterilization of the cage weekly will help eliminate oder, 
			parasites, and bacteria.
		</p>
		<h2>Environment</h2>
		<p>
			The typical housing for rats are cages, aquariums, and homemade residences. 
			Each have pros and cons.

		<p>
			<b>Cages</b>. Wire cages can be found in a variety of sizes, designs, and costs. 
			The most important advantage to a wire cage is ventilation, as the open wires 
			keep ammonia fumes to a minimum. Cages also offer your rats more stimulation, 
			as it is easier to implement additional levels and ramps to move around on, as 
			well as places to hang accessories. They are also more open to interaction with 
			the rest of the household. However, there are some downsides to cages. Rat food 
			and litter are more likely to end up on the floor than other types of housing. 
			Wire floors can also lead to foot injuries or can aggrivate a condition known as 
			bumblefoot. However, covering wire floor with solid flooring such as linoleum, 
			cloth, or needlepoint mesh can alleviate this issue.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Aquariums</b>. Glass aquariums typically come in a variety of sizes and 
			heights. If using just a glass aquarium, make sure that the cover locks down 
			to prevent rats from escaping. Special water bottles that hang from the edges 
			of the tank will need to be obtained. Many people find aquariums easier to clean, 
			and rat food and litter remains inside the aquarium instead of ending up on 
			the floor. Aquariums are also less drafty than cages, which is good for a hairless 
			rat or a rat that is ill. However, aquariums are more prone to elevated ammonia 
			fumes and overheating. They will need to be cleaned much more often for health 
			purposes. Glass is also easier to break than wire cages. However, as depected above, 
			expandable cage toppers that fit on top of aquariums are available to add space 
			and ventilation to a rat home.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Homemade Cabinet Housing</b>. Another housing option are homemade cabinet 
			style cages, sometimes called "grotto" cages. One of the best things about 
			cabinet cages is that the rat room generally remains much cleaner than with 
			the conventional cage system. Also, the many levels leaves ample room for 
			placing toys, hammocks, and other things to keep your rats stimulated. 
			However, one of the cons of cabinet cages is that they are usually larger and 
			thus harder to move around and sterilize. One important thing is that the 
			wood needs to be protected. Bare wood can soak up urine and become very unpleasant 
			for you, and unhealthy for your rats.
